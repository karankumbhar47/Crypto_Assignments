Transition(s) Leading to Maximum Differential Probability:

Maximum Value Identification: Scanning the matrix, the maximum value is 6.

Finding Transitions: The value 6 appears at the following positions in the matrix:
    Row 7, Column 6
    Row 12, Column 11

Therefore, the transitions leading to the maximum differential probability of 6 are:
    Input difference 7 to output difference 6
    Input difference 12 to output difference 11

In summary, the maximum differential probability of the S-box is 6/16, and the transitions that lead to this probability are:

    Input difference 7 to output difference 6
    Input difference 12 to output difference 11

Maximum Differential Probability:

The Maximum Differential Probability (MDP) is:
MDP=6/16=0.375
MDP=6/16​=0.375

This is the highest differential probability for the S-box.
Conclusion:

The maximum differential probability for the S-box is 0.375, and it is achieved by the transitions:

    Input difference 7 → Output difference 6
    Input difference 12 → Output difference 11.

Maximum Bias: The maximum absolute value in the LAT is 6 (excluding LAT[0][0]). It occurs in multiple positions:
    LAT[6][8] = -6
    LAT[11][6] = -6
    LAT[12][3] = 6

Maximum Bias Calculation: The maximum bias can be expressed as a fraction of the total number of inputs:
Bias=616=0.375
Bias=166​=0.375

Input-Output Mask(s) Leading to Maximum Bias: The maximum bias of 6 is achieved with the following input-output mask combinations:
    Input mask 6 → Output mask 8
    Input mask 11 → Output mask 6
    Input mask 12 → Output mask 3

Conclusion:

The maximum bias of your S-box is 0.375, and it is achieved by the following input-output mask combinations:

    Input mask 6 → Output mask 8
    Input mask 11 → Output mask 6
    Input mask 12 → Output mask 3.
