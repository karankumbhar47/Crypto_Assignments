\begin{Problem}

    \textbf{Automated Cryptanalysis (MILP)}

    Create an example as shown in class to demonstrate your understanding of an optimization
    problem.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item State the objective function.
        \item State the constraints and justify them.
        \item State the restrictions on the variables.
        \item Generate the \texttt{.lp} file using the syntax shown in the sample file used in class.
        \item Solve it using \texttt{Gurobi} solver.
    \end{itemize}

\end{Problem}

\begin{Solution}

\begin{lstlisting}
    
You are the manager of a small bakery for a day. The bakery produces cakes and muffins, both of which consume some amount of ingredients and labor.

    Total ingredients available for the day: 150 units
    Total labor available for the day: 120 hours

Logistics for producing a cake:

    Requires 8 units of ingredients and 5 hours of labor
    Sells for a profit of ₹500 per cake

Logistics for producing a muffin:

    Requires 4 units of ingredients and 3 hours of labor
    Sells for a profit of ₹200 per muffin

Your task is to determine how many cakes and muffins to produce to maximize profit.
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Gurobi Code and solution}

    \begin{lstlisting}
        Maximize
        500 x + 200 y
        Subject To
        R0: 8 x + 4 y <= 150
        R1: 5 x + 3 y <= 120
        Bounds
        0 <= x
        0 <= y
        Generals
        x y
        End

    # Objective value = 9200
    # x 18
    # y 1

    
    \end{lstlisting}

\end{Solution}
