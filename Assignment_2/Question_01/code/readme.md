# Linear Cryptanalysis of a 3-Round Cipher

## Files
- `main.py`: The main file to run the key recovery process.
- `guessk2.py`: Responsible for guessing the round 2 key.
- `sypher00B.py`: Handles key refinement and final key guessing.

## How to Run

1. Make sure all files (`main.py`, `guessk2.py`, `sypher00B.py`) are in the same directory.
2. Run the `main.py` file:
    ```bash
    python3 main.py
    ```

This will perform the full cryptanalysis and output the expected final keys.
