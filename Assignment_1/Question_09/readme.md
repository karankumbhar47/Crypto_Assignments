# Running the SageMath Script

Follow the steps below to run the `Q9.sage` file and view the output.

## Using the Command Line

1. **Navigate to the Directory**: Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where the `Q9.sage` file is located.

    ```bash

    This will run the SageMath script and display the results directly in the terminal.

## Using a Jupyter Notebook

1. **Start SageMath with Jupyter**: Open a terminal and start a Jupyter Notebook session with SageMath by executing the following command:

    ```bash
    sage -n jupyter
    ```

2. **Create a New Notebook**: In the Jupyter interface that opens in your web browser, create a new notebook. Make sure to select the SageMath kernel when prompted.

3. **Copy and Paste the Code**: Open the `Q9.sage` file in any text editor, copy the entire code, and paste it into the cells of the new Jupyter notebook.

4. **Run the Cells**: Click on each cell containing the code and press `Shift + Enter` to execute the cells. The output will be displayed below each cell.
