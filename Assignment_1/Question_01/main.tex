\begin{Problem}
    \textbf{Capture The Flag}\\
    Demonstrate how you solved the CTF that lead you to this Assignment? If your group is
    among the first three teams then, you will receive bonus points. However, every group must
    justify how they got hold of this pdf file.

    \textbf{Note}: \textit{If you are unable to justify this then the rest of the solutions will not be accepted.}
\end{Problem}

\begin{Solution}

    Key Points
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[1.] We know that link will always start with "https://" which contain pattern.
        \item[2.] We also know that link will always end with "sharing" which will help to 
            stop while decrypting link.
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Setps}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Firstly we created \texttt{cipherText.txt} which contain red and blcak colored cipher text
              seperated by new line character.
        \item Then with the help of \texttt{chipherToAscii} function from \texttt{ascii.py}  file, converted all
              character to corresponding ascii numbers between 0 to 127
        \item Then we find the pattern which match with encryption of "https://" which
              contain same characters at 2\textsuperscript{nd} and 3\textsuperscript{rd}. Also same pattern observed with 7\textsuperscript{th}
              and 8\textsuperscript{th} position. We use \texttt{getPatternIndex}  from \texttt{ascii.py} file for pattern
              finding. This funtion will return the starting index of such pattern.
        \item After Finding such pattern we find key $(k_0,k_1,k_2)$ from message and chipher text
              pairs with eliminating invalid keys. We use \texttt{tryAllKey} and \texttt{getKey} function from 
              \texttt{utils.py} file to eliminate invalid key with iteration through known message and chipher
              text pairs.
        \item After getting a key for particular pattern, We find correspondig link using derived keys
              from above result and start index of pattern until we get "sharing" at the end of link.
              We are achieving this with help of funciton \texttt{getLink} from \texttt{utils.py} file
        \item After getting link for each pattern we will figure out correct link by opening each link. 
    \end{enumerate}
    \vspace*{5}

    \textbf{Note} All the files required to get link are attached in current directory of question 1. To get links 
    run \texttt{attack.py} file. This will dumps multiple links in your terminal with corresponding links.
    Correct link is one of them.
