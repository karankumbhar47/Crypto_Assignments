# Vigen√®re Cipher Decryption

To ensure smooth execution, you'll need to set up a Python virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**: Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your system.

## Instructions

### 1. Setup

1. **Create a New Directory**:
   - It's recommended to run this script in a new, empty directory to avoid conflicts with other files.
   - You can create a directory with:
     ```bash
     mkdir vigenere_test && cd vigenere_test
     ```

2. **Copy the File and Requirements**:
   - Place the `vigenere.py` and `requirements.txt` files into your newly created directory.

### 2. Setting Up a Virtual Environment

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   - Run the following command to create a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   - On **Windows**:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On **macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

### 3. Installing Dependencies

1. **Install the Required Packages**:
   - Use `pip` to install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

### 4. Running the Script

1. **Execute the Script**:
   - With the virtual environment activated, run the script using:
     ```bash
     python vigenere.py
     ```

    Here Observe the Plaintext for different keys where for 1 key their is valid english word, which you will notice in output.

### 5. Deactivating the Virtual Environment

1. **Deactivate**:
   - After running the script, you can deactivate the virtual environment by typing:
     ```bash
     deactivate
     ```
