\begin{Problem}
    An affine cryptosystem is given by the following encryption function, where $a, b$ are chosen
    from $\mathbb{Z}_{26}$.
    \begin{align*}
        enc_{a,b} : \mathbb{Z}_{26} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{26} \\
        x \rightarrow $ax + b$    \epsilon    \mathbb{Z}_{26}
    \end{align*}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Encrypt the plaintext cryptography using the affine code $enc_{3,5}$. What is the decryption
              function corresponding to $enc_{3,5}$? Decrypt the ciphertext XRHLAFUUK.
        \item A central requirement of cryptography is that the plaintext must be computable from the \\
              key and the ciphertext. Explain why $enc_{2,3}$ violates this rule. Show that the function \\
              enca,b satisfies the rule if and only if $gcd(a, 26) = 1$.
        \item
              In the following we consider only functions enca,b with $gcd(a, 26) = 1$. Show that all affine
              codes with $b = 0$ map the letter $a$ to a and the letter $n$ to n.
    \end{itemize}
\end{Problem}

\begin{Solution}

    \textbf{Part 1: Encryption and Decryption}

    We are given the plaintext \textit{cryptography} and the affine cipher parameters $a = 3$ and $b = 5$. The encryption function is given by:
    \[
    \text{enc}_{3,5}(x) = 3x + 5 \mod 26
    \]
    The decryption function can be derived by finding the modular inverse of $a$ modulo 26. Let's calculate it using the Python code provided.

    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Affine Cipher Encryption and Decryption]
def modinv(a, m):
    for x in range(1, m):
        if (a * x) % m == 1:
            return x
    return None

def encrypt(mssge,a,b):
    c = ""
    for i in mssge:
        if i.isalpha():
            if i.islower():
                c += chr(((a*(ord(i)-97)+b)%26)+97)
            else:
                c += chr(((a*(ord(i)-65)+b)%26)+65)
        else:
            c += i
    return c

def decrypt(cipher, a, b):
    mssge = ""
    for i in cipher:
        if i.isalpha():
            if i.islower():
                mssge += chr(((modinv(a, 26)*(ord(i)-97-b))%26)+97)
            else:
                mssge += chr(((modinv(a, 26)*(ord(i)-65-b))%26)+65)
        else:
            mssge += i
    return mssge

cipher = encrypt("cryptography", 3, 5)
print(cipher)
print(decrypt("XRHLAFUUK", 3, 5))
    \end{lstlisting}

    The ciphertext for \textit{cryptography} using $a = 3$ and $b = 5$ is \textbf{XRHLAFUUK}. The corresponding decryption function yields the original plaintext when applied to the ciphertext.

    \textbf{Part 2: Why does $enc_{2,3}$ violate the rule?}

    A central requirement in cryptography is that the plaintext must be computable from the key and the ciphertext. For $enc_{2,3}$, the encryption function is:
    \[
    \text{enc}_{2,3}(x) = 2x + 3 \mod 26
    \]
    However, the key $a = 2$ is not invertible modulo 26 because $\gcd(2, 26) \neq 1$. Specifically, $\gcd(2, 26) = 2$, which means there is no unique inverse for 2 modulo 26, and therefore, decryption is not guaranteed to retrieve the original plaintext. This violates the requirement that the plaintext should be retrievable from the ciphertext and the key.

    \textbf{Part 3: All affine codes with $b = 0$ map the letter $a$ to $a$ and the letter $n$ to $n$.}

    When $b = 0$, the affine encryption function simplifies to:
    \[
    \text{enc}_{a,0}(x) = ax \mod 26
    \]
    If we take $x = 0$ (which corresponds to the letter 'a'), then:
    \[
    \text{enc}_{a,0}(0) = 0 \mod 26
    \]
    which means 'a' is mapped to 'a'.

    Similarly, for $x = 13$ (which corresponds to the letter 'n'):
    \[
    \text{enc}_{a,0}(13) = 13a \mod 26
    \]
    Since $13a \mod 26 = 13$ (as long as $a$ is odd and $\gcd(a, 26) = 1$), the letter 'n' is mapped to 'n'.
