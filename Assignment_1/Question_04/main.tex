\begin{Problem}
    An affine cryptosystem is given by the following encryption function, where $a, b$ are chosen
    from $\mathbb{Z}_{26}$.
    \begin{align*}
        enc_{a,b} : \mathbb{Z}_{26} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{26} \\
        x \rightarrow $ax + b$    \epsilon    \mathbb{Z}_{26}
    \end{align*}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Encrypt the plaintext cryptography using the affine code $enc_{3,5}$. What is the decryption
              function corresponding to $enc_{3,5}$? Decrypt the ciphertext XRHLAFUUK.
        \item A central requirement of cryptography is that the plaintext must be computable from the \\
              key and the ciphertext. Explain why $enc_{2,3}$ violates this rule. Show that the function \\
              enca,b satisfies the rule if and only if $gcd(a, 26) = 1$.
        \item
              In the following we consider only functions enca,b with $gcd(a, 26) = 1$. Show that all affine
              codes with $b = 0$ map the letter $a$ to a and the letter $n$ to n.
    \end{itemize}
\end{Problem}
