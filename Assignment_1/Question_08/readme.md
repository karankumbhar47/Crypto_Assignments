# How to Run the Code

## 1. Install SageMath

If you haven't installed SageMath yet, download and install it from the official [SageMath website](https://www.sagemath.org/). Follow the installation instructions based on your operating system.

## 2. Prepare the Ciphertext

Before running the script, you need to have the ciphertext that you want to decrypt. Update the `ciphertext` variable in the `cryptanalysis.sage` script with your actual encrypted text.

## 3. Running the Script

### Open SageMath:

- **Command Line**:
  - Open a terminal and type `sage` to start the SageMath command line.
  
- **Graphical Interface**:
  - Alternatively, you can use the SageMath Notebook interface if you prefer a graphical environment.

### Run the Script:

- **Command Line**:
  - Navigate to the directory where your `Q8.sage` file is located.
  - Run the script by typing:
    ```bash
    sage Q8.sage
    ```

- **SageMath Notebook**:
  - Simply open the script file in the notebook interface and run it.
